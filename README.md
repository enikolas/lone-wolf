# Lone Wolf

TODO:
- Don't let scrollbar appearing jump the page
  - Couldn't detect the scrollbar appearing properly :/
- Don't let character sheet content growth grow the section
- Favicon
- Background sounds
- Images
- Better styling
- Styling solution that's better than inline on components

REFACTORS:
- Change endurancePoints to EP everywhere
- Make the GM a normal player with "isGM". Then get rid of `?`s in characterSheet
