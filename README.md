# Lone Wolf

TODO:
- Bigger character sheet entries
- Don't let scrollbar appearing jump the page
- Don't let character sheet content growth grow the section
- Favicon
- Background sounds
- Images
- HTTPS access (needs WSS)

REFACTORS:
- Change endurancePoints to EP everywhere
- Make the GM a normal player with "isGM". Then get rid of `?`s in characterSheet
